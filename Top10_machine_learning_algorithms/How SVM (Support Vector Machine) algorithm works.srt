Hello, I will explain how SVM algorithm works.
This video will explain the support vector

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:17,099
machine for linearly separable binary sets
Suppose we have this two features, x1 and

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,680
x2 here and we want to classify all this elements
You can see that we have the class square

4
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:33,929
and the class rectangle
So the goal of the SVM is to design a hyperplane,

5
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,610
here we define this green line as the hyperplane,
that classifies all the training vectors in

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:47,570
two classes
Here we show two different hyperplanes which

7
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,570
can classify correctly all the instances in
this feature set

8
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,570
But the best choice will be the hyperplane
that leaves the maximum margin from both classes

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,070
The margin is this distance between the hyperplane
and the closest elements from this hyperplane

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,750
We have the case of the red hyperplane we
have this distance, so this is the margin,

11
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:23,010
which we represent by z1
And in the case of the green hyperplane we

12
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:30,010
have the margin that we call z2
We can clearly see that the value of z2 is

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,360
greater than z1
So the margin is higher in the case of the

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,360
green hyperplane, so in this case the best
choice will be the green hyperplane

15
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Suppose we have this hyperplane, this hyperplane
is defined by one equation, we can state this

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,680
equation as this one
We have a vector of weights plus omega 0 and

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,520
this equation will deliver values greater
than 1 for all the input vectors which belongs

18
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,530
to the class 1, in this case the circles
And also, we scale this hyperplane so that

19
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,420
it will deliver values smaller than -1 for
all values which belongs to class number 2,

20
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,980
the rectangles
We can say that this distance to the closest

21
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,410
elements will be at least 1, the modulus is
1

22
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,349
From the geometry we know that the distance
between a point and a hyperplane is computed

23
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:51,349
by this equation
So the total margin which is composed by this

24
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:59,099
distance will be computed by this equation
And the aim is that minimizing this term will

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,200
maximize the separability
When we minimize this weight vector we will

26
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:16,790
have the biggest margin here that will split
this two classes

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,280
To minimize this weight vector is a nonlinear
optimization task, which can be solved by

28
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,060
this conditions (KKT), which uses Langrange
multipliers

29
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:38,060
The main equations state that the value of
omega will be the solution of this sum here

30
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,849
And we also have this other rule. So when
we solve these equations, trying to minimize

31
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:52,849
this omega vector, we will maximize the margin
between the two classes which will maximize

32
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:01,379
the separability the two classes
Here we show a simple example

33
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:08,819
Suppose we have these 2 features, x1 and x2,
and we have these 3 values

34
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:15,819
We want to design, or to find the best hyperplane
that will divide this 2 classes

35
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:24,150
So we know that we can see clearly from this
graph that the best division line will be

36
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,990
a parallel line to the line that connects
these 2 values here

37
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,990
So we can define this weight vector, which
is this point minus this other point. So we

38
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,629
have the constant a and 2 times this constant
a

39
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:51,629
Now we can solve this weight vector and create
the hyperplane equations considering this

40
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:59,539
weight vector
We must discover the values of this a here

41
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:06,539
Since we have this weight vector omega here,
we can substitute the values of this point

42
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:13,639
and also using this point we can substitute
these 2 values here

43
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:20,639
When we place the equation g using the input
vector (1,1) we know that we have the value

44
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:30,469
-1 because this belongs to the class circle
So we will have this value here, when we use

45
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:39,499
the second point, we apply the function and
we know that it will deliver the value 1

46
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:46,719
So we substitute here in the equation also
Well, given 2 equations we can isolate the

47
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,819
value of omega 0 in the second equation and
we will have omega 0 equal to 1 minus 8 times

48
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,659
a
So, using this value, we put the omega 0 in

49
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:06,659
the first equation and we will reach the value
of a, which is 2 divided by 5

50
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:13,899
Now we discover the value of a and now we
substitute the first equation and also discover

51
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,909
the value of omega 0
So by dividing here we will come to the conclusion

52
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:26,909
that omega 0 is minus 11 divided by 5 and
since we know that the weight vector is a

53
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:35,059
and 2 a we can substitute the value of a here
and we will deliver these values of the weight

54
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:44,149
vector
So in this case, these are called the support

55
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:51,149
vectors because they compose the omega value
2 divided by 5 and 4 divided by 5

56
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:58,589
And we substitute here the values of omega
(2 divided by 5 and 4 divided by 5) and also

57
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,740
the omega 0 value we will deliver the final
equation which defines this green hyperplane

58
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:16,729
which is x1 plus 2 times x2 minus 5.5
And this hyperplane classifies the elements

59
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:27,289
using support vector machines
These are some references that we have used

60
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,990
So this is how SVM algorithm works
